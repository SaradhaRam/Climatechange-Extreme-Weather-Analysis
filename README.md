# Is climate change correlated with extreme weather events? - Analysis 

Weather DataMembers: John Gotz, Sara Ram, Joe Sellner, Guy BssoumeMain Question: Is climate change correlated with extreme weather events?

Outline: We are going to be comparing the occurrence of specific natural disasters against average temperature in the U.S. Temp. 
Data will be imported from a csv from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We are breaking theproject into 4 
natural disasters which are shown below. Each person will be creating two plots. One bar plot showing the number of disasters per year.
A second scatter plot demonstrating occurrence of natural disasters against the average temperature. We will be plotting our regression
line on this scatter plot. Finally, we will plot average temp. against the year and predict the temperature in 2022. Using our regression
lines from earlier, we will create a data frame that predicts the natural disaster occurrence in this year.Is climate change correlated with
